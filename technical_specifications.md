# Financial Distress Predictor: Technical Specifications

## Overview

The purpose of this Streamlit application is to predict the financial distress of companies using a machine learning model trained on synthetic data. Leveraging interactive features and visualization techniques, the application provides users insights into which financial ratios most influence distress predictions. The application serves as a practical demonstration of the concepts discussed in the chapter on "Challenges and Applications of AI in Finance" from the book *AI and Big Data in Investments*.

## Application Components

### User Input

- **Input Form**: 
  - Users are provided with a form to input key financial ratios such as the debt-to-equity ratio, current ratio, and others. This captures essential input needed for a financial distress prediction.
  - Implement using `st.text_input` and `st.number_input` for input fields, providing a user-friendly interface.
  
### Synthetic Dataset

- **Dataset Generation**:
  - A synthetic dataset is generated to simulate real-world financial data, enabling the model to train on both distressed and non-distressed company profiles.
  - The dataset includes numeric values for financial ratios and categorical labels indicating financial status, structured to benefit ML training.

### Machine Learning Model

- **Model Selection**:
  - Implement a logistic regression or random forest model as the primary machine learning model. These models are known for their effectiveness in binary classification problems such as financial distress prediction.
  - The model is trained using Scikit-Learn's implementation and includes a proper train-test split.
  
- **Prediction**:
  - Users can trigger the prediction through a button after entering their data. The model then outputs the probability of financial distress.
  - Display results using `st.write` to present the predicted probability in a clear, concise manner.

### Visualization

- **Feature Importance Visualization**:
  - A bar chart is produced to show the importance of each feature, helping users understand what financial ratios have the most significant impact on the model's predictions.
  - Utilize `matplotlib` or `plotly` for creating visually appealing and informative bar charts.
  
- **Interactive Charts**:
  - Implement interactive line charts, bar graphs, and scatter plots to illustrate trends, allowing users to dynamically explore underlying patterns in the data.
  - Employ Streamlitâ€™s interactive chart libraries like Altair for seamless integration.

### User Interaction and Guidance

- **Interactivity**:
  - Widgets and control elements are provided to enable real-time experimentation and visual feedback as users adjust input parameters.
  - Conditional logic triggers component updates, enriching user engagement with responsive feedback.
  
- **Documentation and Tooltips**:
  - Embed inline help documentation and tooltips throughout the application to guide users. For example, hover-over tooltips explain different financial ratios and prediction results.
  - Use `st.help` and `st.tooltip` features to support user navigation and learning.

## Relation to Course Material

This single-page application illustrates the practical implementation of concepts described in the chapter on "Challenges and Applications of AI in Finance". Specifically, it demonstrates how machine learning models can be trained on financial indicators to predict stock crashes, which is directly related to predicting financial distress. It provides an interactive, hands-on experience, reinforcing the understanding of ML applications in risk management and investment decision-making processes, as explored in the provided text.
